  NDIS Advisor Questionnaire
subquestion: |
  Welcome to our NDIS Eligibility Questionnaire!
  
  The purpose of this questionnaire is to decide whether you are likely eligible
  for the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) and to give you tips for the
  next steps in applying.
  
  **This questionnaire currently only applies for people with autism spectrum disorder.**
  
    ***Disclaimer***  
  
    This questionnaire is **not** legal advice. 
  
    Please answer all questions honestly.
    
    This questionnaire does not guarantee you will receive funding from the NDIS. 
    It will help you assess whether you are likely eligible and give you tips
    on the next steps.
    
    **The NDIA will make the final decision.**
    
    *We advise you to have a support person while filling out the questionnaire.*
